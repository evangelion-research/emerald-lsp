# Emerald LSP

A language server for the Emerald programming language. The working document is
[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md), which lays out what it takes to get from `emeraldc`
(7,000+ lines of C11: `lexer → parser → module link → check → codegen`, plus a
mark-and-sweep runtime) to a working language server.

The headline of the design: **most of the work is in the compiler, not the LSP
server.** The protocol layer is a few hundred lines of glue; the analysis
capabilities the protocol needs — error recovery, source ranges, a type
side-table, a symbol table — do not exist yet and all live in the compiler.

## Status

**v0.1 — a working server, running ahead of the compiler surgery.**
`emerald_lsp/` is Python + `pygls`, as designed. It answers the whole
protocol lifecycle today, in two layers with very different reach:

| Feature | How it works | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Diagnostics | local unused-code analysis plus `emeraldc --check --json` per document version, debounced | Go-style unused imports and local bindings are reported as errors; type checking still needs `emeraldc`, and it reports one syntax error at a time until the parser recovers (§1a) |
| Semantic tokens | this package's own Emerald lexer | purely lexical, and deliberately so — it survives a broken import graph |
| Document symbols, folding | a token-level outline | no types |
| Hover | declaration text, or the builtin/keyword table | shows the *declaration*, not an inferred type (§4b) |
| Goto-definition | the outline, plus `import` resolution | cross-file for imported names; scope-approximate for locals (§4c) |
| Completion | keywords, builtins, in-scope names; module paths after `import`; a module's exports after `from m import` and after `m.` | field completion on a **value** stays silent — it needs the checker's type for the receiver |
| References, highlights | name matches | this file only |
| Workspace symbols | top-level names across `*.rald` | top-level only |

What is *not* here, and why: inlay hints, rename, and code actions all need the
type side table and symbol table of `DESIGN.md` §4, and formatting needs a
pretty-printer that does not exist. The compiler-surgery list in §1 — error
recovery, end positions, allocation, structured output — still blocks the good
version of every row above. This server is built so that landing it is a
rewrite of the analysis layer only: `emerald_lsp/compiler.py` grows a
`--lsp-index` call, and the handlers stop reading `emerald_lsp/outline.py`.

## Install

```
uv tool install emerald-lsp      # or: pipx install emerald-lsp
emerald-lsp --version
```

From a checkout:

```
uv sync
uv run emerald-lsp --help
```

The server needs `emeraldc` on `PATH` for compiler diagnostics — set
`emerald.compilerPath` or `$EMERALDC` if it lives elsewhere. Without it,
syntax features and unused-code diagnostics still work; the server says so
once and carries on.

To see the exact query the server makes per keystroke:

```
emerald-lsp --check path/to/file.rald
```

## Editor setup

**Neovim** (0.11+):

```lua
vim.filetype.add({ extension = { rald = "emerald" } })
vim.lsp.config.emerald = {
  cmd = { "emerald-lsp" },
  filetypes = { "emerald" },
  root_markers = { "emerald.toml", "src", ".git" },
  settings = { emerald = { includePaths = {} } },
}
vim.lsp.enable("emerald")
```

**Helix** (`languages.toml`):

```toml
[language-server.emerald-lsp]
command = "emerald-lsp"

[[language]]
name = "emerald"
file-types = ["rald"]
comment-token = "#"
language-servers = ["emerald-lsp"]
indent = { tab-width = 4, unit = "    " }
```

**Zed / VS Code**: point the client at the `emerald-lsp` binary over stdio.
`--tcp --port N` is available for debugging a client that cannot spawn a
process.

### Configuration

All keys live under `emerald` in `initializationOptions` or
`workspace/didChangeConfiguration`:

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `compilerPath` | `emeraldc` on `PATH` | the checker to run |
| `includePaths` | `[]` | extra `-I` roots, before the lockfile's |
| `diagnostics.enabled` | `true` | run the checker at all |
| `proof` | `false` | pass `--proof` (promotes warnings to errors) |
| `debounceMs` | `250` | idle time before a check |
| `timeoutSeconds` | `10` | give up on a wedged compiler |

## Development

```
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
```

The suite covers the lexer, the outline, position encoding, the diagnostic
mapping, the lockfile `-I` rule, and the features — plus two kinds of test the
design calls out: a truncation fuzz over every prefix of several samples, and
end-to-end sessions that drive the real server process over stdio with a stub
compiler.

Layout:

```
emerald_lsp/lexer.py       an Emerald tokenizer (mirrors src/lexer.c)
emerald_lsp/outline.py     token-level symbols, scopes, imports
emerald_lsp/modules.py     import resolution (mirrors docs/modules.md)
emerald_lsp/compiler.py    the emeraldc subprocess seam, and pme's -I rule
emerald_lsp/diagnostics.py compiler JSON -> LSP diagnostics
emerald_lsp/semantic.py    semantic tokens
emerald_lsp/features.py    hover, definition, completion, symbols
emerald_lsp/positions.py   byte<->char columns, path<->URI
emerald_lsp/server.py      pygls handlers, debounce, cache
```

## pme — the package manager

`pme` — the package manager for Emerald, in design as a Python driver over the
same `-I` seam — is designed alongside this server. The two share one rule:

> **pme resolves, the LSP consumes.** The server reads `emerald.lock` and
> applies pme's frozen `-I` rule (each locked package's `src/` under
> `~/.emerald/store/`, dependencies before dependents). It never reimplements
> resolution — no version solving, no registry reads, no fetches.

`emerald.toml` and `emerald.lock` are analysis inputs: their changes are
watched and invalidate the analysis cache. pme's full implementation plan
(milestones 1–6, from manifest/lockfile/semver through a Stage-1 registry)
lives in the appendix of `DESIGN.md`.
