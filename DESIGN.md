# Emerald LSP — design

Notes on what it takes to get from `emeraldc` (7,041 lines of C11:
`lexer → parser → module link → check → codegen`, plus a mark-and-sweep
runtime) to a working language server.

The headline is unchanged: **most of the work is in the compiler, not the LSP
server.** The protocol layer is a few hundred lines of glue. The analysis
capabilities the protocol needs — error recovery, source ranges, a type
side-table, a symbol table — do not exist yet and all live in `../emerald/src`.

**What changed since the first draft of these notes.** Emerald grew a module
system (`src/module.c`, `include/module.h`, `docs/modules.md`), a C backend,
and a GC'd runtime. The module system is the consequential one: the earlier
version of this document listed "no cross-file resolution" as a large chunk of
work Emerald let us skip. That is no longer true, and it changes the
architecture — see §2. The compiler-surgery list in §1 is unchanged and still
blocks everything.

---

## 0. Language choice: Python for the server

**Decision: Python + `pygls` for the protocol layer, C stays for analysis.**

The split matters. There are two jobs here and they have opposite
requirements:

| Job | Wants | Language |
|---|---|---|
| Analysis (parse, link, typecheck, resolve names) | speed, direct AST access, the existing 7k lines of compiler | **C** — already written |
| Protocol (JSON-RPC, document sync, position math, debounce) | JSON, string handling, async, fast iteration | **Python** |

Writing the protocol layer in C means hand-rolling a JSON parser, an event
loop, UTF-16 offset arithmetic, and a document store — several hundred lines
of fiddly code that has nothing to do with Emerald, plus it forces the arena
allocator problem (§1c) on day one. That is the overkill path and it buys
nothing: the protocol layer is not the hot path. A keystroke budget is ~100ms;
JSON-RPC decode is sub-millisecond in any language.

### Why `pygls` specifically

`pygls` (with `lsprotocol` for the typed message definitions) gives you for
free the parts that are tedious and easy to get subtly wrong:

- `Content-Length` framing over stdio
- the `initialize` / `initialized` / `shutdown` / `exit` lifecycle and
  capability negotiation
- an in-memory document store fed by `didOpen` / `didChange` / `didClose`,
  including incremental sync if you enable it
- typed request/response models, so a malformed `Hover` is a type error
  rather than a client that silently ignores you
- request cancellation plumbing
- workspace folders and file watching (`workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`),
  which the module system now makes necessary

What's left for you is a set of decorated handler functions:

```python
@server.feature(TEXT_DOCUMENT_HOVER)
def hover(ls, params: HoverParams) -> Hover | None:
    doc = ls.workspace.get_text_document(params.text_document.uri)
    result = analyze(doc.source, hover_at=params.position)
    ...
```

### Costs of Python, honestly

1. **Distribution.** A Go or Rust server ships as one static binary; a
   Python server needs an interpreter and dependencies. Mitigations, in
   order of preference:
   - publish to PyPI, tell users `uv tool install emerald-lsp` (or `pipx`);
     one command, isolated env, works everywhere
   - for the VS Code extension, bundle a venv or use PyInstaller so users
     install nothing
   - this is a real cost but a one-time packaging problem, not an ongoing
     tax on development
2. **Startup latency.** ~50–150ms for the interpreter plus imports. Paid
   once when the editor launches the server, then never again. Irrelevant.
3. **Per-request latency.** Only matters if you do analysis *in* Python,
   which you are not. See §2 — Python shells out or FFIs into C.
4. **GIL / concurrency.** Not a factor at this scale. `pygls` runs an
   asyncio loop; analysis happens in a subprocess, so it doesn't block.

### The alternative, if you change your mind later

Go (`sourcegraph/jsonrpc2`) is the other sane choice, purely for the
single-binary distribution story. The architecture below is unchanged
either way — the C side exposes JSON, and whoever consumes it is
interchangeable. Don't pick Go now for a distribution problem you don't
have yet. Ship in Python; port the ~400 lines of glue later if packaging
ever becomes the thing users complain about.

---

## 1. Make the compiler survivable as a library

`emeraldc` is a batch tool that assumes "one file, one process, then die."
Four assumptions break under an editor. All four are still open.

### 1a. The parser exits on the first syntax error

`src/parser.c:34` — `perror_at()` renders the diagnostic and calls `exit(1)`
(line 43). An editor buffer is syntactically broken most of the time you are
typing, so this is fatal, not cosmetic. There are ten `perror_at()` call sites
and they all terminate the process. Needed:

- **Error recovery.** On an unexpected token, record the diag and *panic-sync*
  to the next statement boundary — `}`, a newline at statement start, or one
  of `def`, `type`, `import`, `from`, `if`, `while`, `for`, `return` — then
  keep parsing.
- **An `S_ERROR` statement kind** (and `E_ERROR` expression kind) so the AST
  stays well-shaped even where the text is garbage. Completion inside a
  half-typed expression depends on there being *a* node at the cursor.
- `parse_program()` returns a partial `Program*` plus diags, and never exits.
  Its header comment (`include/parser.h`) currently documents the exit; update
  it to document the recovery contract instead.

Also `advance()` at `src/parser.c:46` bails on `TK_ERROR` from the lexer. The
lexer produces `TK_ERROR` for unterminated strings (`src/lexer.c:97`) and
unknown characters (`:128`, `:136`) — all three are constant while typing — so
the lexer must emit a token and continue rather than ending the stream.

### 1b. No end positions

`Expr`, `Stmt`, and `TypeExpr` all carry `line`/`col` only (`include/ast.h`).
Every LSP feature wants a **range**, not a point. Add `end_line`/`end_col` to
all three node structs, populated from the token span — `Token` already has
`len` (`include/lexer.h:26`), so the lexer side costs nothing.

This is a wide, mechanical diff. **Do it before writing any server code**,
because everything downstream assumes ranges exist.

### 1c. Everything leaks by design

`include/ast.h`: "Nodes are malloc'd and never freed." Fine for a process,
fatal for a server open for eight hours across 500 keystrokes. The module
loader makes this worse, not better — a reparse now re-reads and re-allocates
the whole import graph. Two options:

- **Arena per linked program** — one bump allocator threaded through parser,
  module loader, and checker; `arena_free()` on relink. Cleanest, and speeds
  up parsing.
- **Process per request** — don't fix it at all; let the OS reclaim. Given
  the file sizes here this is likely <10ms per query and sidesteps the whole
  problem. See §3.

The process-per-request option pairs naturally with the Python decision and
is the recommended starting point.

### 1d. Output goes to stderr, and OOM calls `exit`

`exit(1)` on allocation failure in ~12 places (`check.c:74`, `diag.c:16`,
`module.c:35`, …) is acceptable. But the parser, loader, and checker also
assume stderr is the reporting channel; analysis modes must write structured
output to stdout and keep stderr for genuine crashes. `main.c` already routes
JSON to stdout when `--json` is set (`main.c:139`, `:145`, `:151`) — extend
that discipline rather than inventing a second convention.

---

## 2. The module system changes the shape of the server

`src/module.c` (810 lines) resolves `import` statements to files, loads the
transitive graph, mangles each imported module's top-level names to
`<module>__<name>`, and links everything into a **single `Program`** —
dependencies first, entry module last. Read `docs/modules.md` before touching
any of this.

Four consequences, in descending order of how much they will hurt.

### 2a. The loader reads from disk; an editor has unsaved buffers

`module.c:211` `read_file()` opens the resolved path with `fopen`. In an
editor, the file on disk is stale for every modified buffer in the workspace —
including the entry file's dependencies, which the user may be editing in
another tab.

**Required: an overlay hook in the loader.** Give `module_link()` a way to
consult caller-provided source text before falling back to the filesystem:

```c
typedef const char *(*ModuleOverlay)(const char *canonical_path, void *ud);

Program *module_link(const char *entry, const char *const *roots, size_t nroots,
                     ModuleOverlay overlay, void *overlay_ud,
                     DiagList *diags, int *errors);
```

`read_file()` calls the overlay first, keyed on the **canonical** path
(`module.c:164` already computes one — module identity is the canonical path,
so the overlay must key on the same thing or a file reached two ways will get
two different texts). On the CLI the overlay is NULL and nothing changes.

On the Python side, the overlay is fed from `pygls`'s document store: every
open, unsaved buffer in the workspace, passed down as a `{path: text}` map with
the analysis request. This is the single most important new piece of work the
module system creates.

### 2b. Analysis is now per-program, not per-file

A change to `strings.rald` changes the diagnostics of every module that imports
it. That means:

- **A reverse-dependency map.** `module_link` already walks the graph; have it
  report the modules it loaded (their canonical paths) so Python can build
  `{dependency → [dependents]}` and know what to re-analyze on a change.
- **Entry points.** LSP hands you a file, not a program. A leaf module compiled
  alone still type-checks (it is its own entry), so the simple, correct policy
  is: **analyze each open file as its own entry point.** Editing a dependency
  then re-runs analysis for every open dependent, which is exactly the reverse
  map's job. Do not attempt to guess a single "main" for the workspace.
- **Diagnostics fan out.** One analysis run yields diagnostics for several
  files. `Diag` carries `file` (`include/diag.h:40`) and `DiagList` keeps
  per-file sources (`diag.h:60`), so the data is already there — but the Python
  layer must group by file and publish a `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` per
  URI, including **clearing** files that went clean. That last part is the
  classic bug: an empty diagnostic list must still be published.
- **Watch the workspace.** Register `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` for
  `**/*.rald`. A dependency edited outside the editor, or a newly created
  module that resolves a previously failing import, has to invalidate the cache.

### 2c. Names in the linked program are mangled

After linking, `strings.split` is `strings__split`. The AST carries the source
spelling alongside it in two places:

- `Expr.disp` (`ast.h:78`) — NULL means "already spelled the way the user wrote
  it"
- `Stmt.as.func.dispname` and `Stmt.as.tdef.dispname` (`ast.h:137`, `:148`)

**Everything the server shows the user must go through `disp`/`dispname`.** A
hover that reads `strings__split` is a bug; so is a completion item, a rename,
or a document symbol. Rule of thumb: the mangled name is the *identity* used
for matching, the display name is what reaches the wire.

Two gaps to close while adding ranges (§1b), because they have no display name
at all today:

- `module.c:536` mangles `s->as.fr.var` (the `for` loop variable) in place
- `module.c:493` mangles assignment targets in place

Both lose the original spelling. Add a `disp`-style field, or better, keep the
original in the node and mangle into a separate `linked_name` field so nothing
is ever destructive.

Also note `Stmt.file` (`ast.h:115`) — every statement records which file it was
parsed from, and the checker swaps `ck->filename` as it walks
(`check.c:1790-1793`, `:1899-1900`). `Expr` and `TypeExpr` have **no** file
field, so a position index (§4a) must inherit the file from the enclosing
statement. Build that into the index walk from the start.

### 2d. Imports are new LSP features, and new diagnostics

The module system is not only cost — it unlocks features that are now the most
valuable things a user gets from a language server:

- **Goto-definition across files.** Previously impossible; now the common case.
- **Workspace symbols** (`workspace/symbol`) across every module.
- **Import completion.** Two distinct completions, both high value:
  after `import ` / `from `, complete **module paths** by scanning the
  resolution roots (`docs/modules.md`: importing file's directory, the nearest
  `src/`, then each `-I`); after `from m import `, complete **`m`'s exported
  names** — which is exactly "top-level defs, type aliases, and globals not
  starting with `_`" (`module.c:230` `mod_exports`, `:235` `is_private`).
- **Import diagnostics** already exist and should map straight through:
  `E_IMPORT_CYCLE`, `E_IMPORT_PRIVATE`, `E_IMPORT_NAME`, `E_IMPORT_REDEFINE`,
  `E_IMPORT_AMBIGUOUS`. `E_IMPORT_NAME` and `E_IMPORT_PRIVATE` are natural
  code-action targets ("did you mean …", "make `_helper` public").

One thing to protect: `module_link` returns NULL on failure (`module.h:20`), so
a broken import currently kills *all* analysis for the program, including the
type errors in the file the user is actually looking at. Under an editor the
loader should degrade — report the import diagnostic, substitute an empty
module for the unresolvable one, and keep linking — the same recovery
philosophy as §1a, one level up.

### Not needed: package management

Resolution is filesystem-only, driven by `-I` roots. There is no lockfile, no
registry, no version solving. `main.c`'s header explicitly frames the CLI as
"the whole contract between emeraldc and any driver (such as pme) that resolves
packages on its behalf" — so if a package manager arrives, the server keeps
talking to the same `-I` interface and inherits nothing new. Preserve that
boundary.

---

## 3. Architecture: C analyzes, Python speaks

The checker is the valuable, irreplaceable part — structural typing, unions,
flow narrowing, generics, `never`-based exhaustiveness (see `docs/proofs.md`;
`--check` is literally a proof checker). None of that gets reimplemented in
Python. So:

**Extend `emeraldc` into a query backend that emits JSON; Python consumes it.**

New modes alongside the existing `--emit-tokens` / `--emit-ast` / `--check` /
`--emit-c` flags, which this fits cleanly:

```
emeraldc --lsp-diagnostics f.rald      # ~ --check --json, plus end positions
emeraldc --lsp-symbols     f.rald      # document symbols from the AST
emeraldc --lsp-hover       f.rald:12:7 # type + declaration at a position
emeraldc --lsp-index       f.rald      # everything: defs, uses, types, ranges
```

Two input mechanisms are needed, and the second is the module-system tax:

- `--stdin` / `-` for the entry file: the editor buffer, not the file on disk,
  is the source of truth.
- **An overlay manifest** for everything else. Since analysis is per-program
  (§2a), passing one buffer on stdin is not enough. Simplest workable form: a
  `--overlay <file>` flag pointing at a JSON `{ "abs/path.rald": "source…" }`
  map that Python writes to a temp file per request. Slightly less pretty than
  a protocol, but it keeps every query a pasteable shell command, which is
  worth a lot during debugging.

Note the stage split in `main.c:125` — `--emit-tokens` and `--emit-ast` are
per-file views that never follow an import, everything from `--check` onward
runs on the *linked* program. The `--lsp-*` modes belong on the linked side,
with one exception: semantic tokens are purely lexical and should stay per-file
so they keep working when the import graph is broken.

### Transport: subprocess first

Start with `subprocess.run(["emeraldc", "--lsp-index", "-", "--overlay", tmp],
input=src)`.

- fresh process per query means the leak in §1c never matters
- crashes are contained — a checker segfault on weird input returns a
  non-zero exit code instead of taking the server down
- trivially debuggable: every query is a shell command you can paste
- golden-testable exactly like the existing stage tests

Prefer **one fat `--lsp-index` call per document version**, cached in Python,
over one subprocess per hover. Compute the whole index on change (debounced),
then answer hover/definition/completion from the cached structure in memory.
That is one process spawn per ~300ms of typing, not one per cursor move.

The index is now naturally multi-file: one run covers the entry module and
everything it imports, so cache it keyed by `(entry, versions-of-all-loaded-
modules)` and serve queries for any file it covered.

If profiling ever shows the spawn cost mattering, the escape hatch is to
build `libemerald.a` and call it via `ctypes`/`cffi` — the JSON contract
stays identical, so it's a swap of one function, not a rewrite. Do not do
this preemptively.

---

## 4. What the compiler must expose

The real work, mostly new code in `check.c`.

### 4a. A position index

Given `(file, line, col)`, find the innermost AST node containing it. A sorted
flat array of `{file, start, end, node*}` built by a post-parse walk; binary
search within the file's slice, innermost wins. Requires §1b, and must thread
the file down from `Stmt.file` (§2c).

### 4b. An expression → type side table

`infer()` (`check.c:1098`) computes a `Type*` for every expression and throws
it away. Record it: `Expr* → Type*`. That one change gives hover, and is the
input to field completion. `type_write()` (`check.c:393`) already renders types
to strings.

### 4c. A symbol table with locations

The checker has `Var` (`check.c:466`), `Alias` (`:50`), and a function table,
but tracks no definition sites and no use sites. Add
`def_file`/`def_line`/`def_col`/`def_end` to each, and append to a
`references[]` list on every name resolution.

With modules, each entry also needs its **owning module** and its display name,
so that goto-definition on `strings__split` lands in `strings.rald` on the
token spelled `split`.

That single table powers goto-definition, find-references, rename, document
symbols, and workspace symbols.

### 4d. Richer diagnostic JSON

The JSON emitted by `diag.c:174` `render_json()` now has `kind`, `severity`,
`code`, `file`, `line`, `column`, `message`, `expected`, `actual`,
`source_line`, and `notes[{label, value}]`. That is most of the way there —
`severity` and `file` and structured notes all landed with the module work.

What's still missing:

- `end_line` / `end_col` — LSP wants a range to underline. Blocked on §1b.
- `related: [{file, line, col, message}]` — the LSP
  `DiagnosticRelatedInformation` shape, for "defined here" / "other module on
  the cycle" notes. `notes[]` is close but has no location, so it renders as
  text only. Import-cycle and redefinition diagnostics are the obvious first
  users.

---

## 5. The Python layer

With `pygls` doing framing, lifecycle, and the document store, what's left:

- **Analysis cache**: `{entry_uri: (versions, index)}` where `versions` covers
  every module the run loaded, plus the reverse-dependency map from §2b.
  Recompute on `didChange` to any module in the set; serve everything else from
  cache.
- **Debounce**: ~150–300ms idle before spawning the checker; cancel/discard
  in-flight work when a newer document version lands. `asyncio` task
  cancellation, roughly 20 lines. With multi-file analysis, also coalesce:
  one edit to a widely imported module should trigger one batch, not one run
  per dependent in flight.
- **Overlay assembly**: collect every dirty buffer from `ls.workspace` into the
  overlay map on each request (§3). Cheap, and skipping it is the source of the
  most confusing possible bug class — analysis that reflects the disk, not the
  screen.
- **Position encoding** — *the trap*. LSP positions are **0-based lines** and
  **UTF-16 code units**. `emeraldc` uses **1-based lines** and **byte
  columns** (`Token.col`, `Diag.col`, every AST node). Any non-ASCII character
  in a string literal silently shifts every subsequent range on that line.
  Build one conversion module, test it with emoji and accented characters, use
  it at every boundary and nowhere else. LSP 3.17 allows negotiating
  `positionEncoding: "utf-8"` — do that when the client supports it, but keep
  the converter for those that don't.
- **Path ↔ URI**: the compiler speaks canonical filesystem paths
  (`module.c:164`), LSP speaks `file://` URIs. One conversion module, same
  discipline as position encoding. Canonicalize on the Python side too, or
  cache keys will miss on symlinked workspaces.
- **Mapping**: compiler JSON → `lsprotocol` types. Mechanical.

---

## 6. Feature ladder

Ordered by value per unit of work.

1. **Diagnostics** — ~90% done in the compiler. Needs §1a error recovery, §1b
   end positions, and the §2a overlay to be correct for multi-file workspaces.
   Ship alone as v0.1; it is most of the perceived value of any language
   server.
2. **Semantic tokens** — nearly free. The lexer already emits
   `{kind, line, col, len}`; map `TokKind` → LSP token types. Better
   highlighting than any TextMate grammar, it needs no type information, and
   being per-file it survives a broken import graph.
3. **Document symbols + folding ranges** — a walk over `S_FUNC`, `S_TYPEDEF`,
   top-level `S_ASSIGN`, `S_IMPORT`. Gives the outline view and breadcrumbs.
4. **Hover** — position index (§4a) + type side table (§4b). Rendered type
   plus the declaration site, with `disp`/`dispname` on the way out (§2c).
5. **Goto definition** — the symbol table (§4c). Cross-file now, which is
   both more work and much more useful than the single-file version would
   have been.
6. **Completion** — keywords and in-scope names first. Then the two good ones:
   after `.`, resolve the object expression's type and list its record fields
   (structural typing makes this genuinely useful rather than decorative); and
   import completion (§2d), which is cheap because `mod_exports` already
   encodes the rule.
7. **Workspace symbols** — the same table as (5), indexed across every module
   under the workspace roots.
8. **Find references / rename** — the use list; rename is references plus a
   multi-file `WorkspaceEdit`. Renaming an exported name touches every
   importing module, so this is where the reverse-dependency map earns its
   keep — and where mangling will bite if §2c was done sloppily.
9. **Inlay hints** — inferred types on unannotated bindings. Cheap once the
   type table exists, and the best available showcase of the checker.
10. **Code actions** — start with the import diagnostics: `E_IMPORT_NAME` →
    "did you mean", `E_IMPORT_PRIVATE` → "remove the leading underscore",
    unresolved name → "add `from m import x`". Each is a small, well-scoped
    `WorkspaceEdit` and they read as magic.
11. **Formatting** — needs a real pretty-printer over the AST
    (`ast_print_program` emits s-expressions, not source) *and* comment
    retention, which the AST currently discards entirely. A separate project.
    Do it last.

---

## 7. Editor integration

- **VS Code**: `package.json` contributing the `.rald` language,
  `language-configuration.json` (line comment `#`, brackets, auto-closing
  pairs), and ~30 lines of client code launching the server. Bundle the
  Python env so users install nothing. Register a file watcher for `**/*.rald`
  (§2b).
- **Neovim / Helix / Zed**: no extension needed, just config pointing at the
  server binary. Ship copy-pasteable snippets in the README. Set the root
  detection to the nearest `src/` directory, matching the module resolver's own
  rule (`module.c:126` `find_src_root`).
- A minimal TextMate grammar is still worth having as the fallback before
  the server attaches, and for GitHub syntax highlighting.

---

## 8. Testing

Extend the existing golden-test culture rather than inventing something new.
`tests/run_tests.sh` already runs five suites — `lexer`, `parser`, `check`,
`e2e`, `imports` — and `task bless` regenerates every `.expected`. The
`imports` suite is the model to copy: a directory per case, `main.rald` plus
siblings, an optional `flags` file, `bad_*` prefixes for expected failures.

- **Analysis goldens**: `--lsp-index` output diffed against checked-in JSON,
  in `tests/lsp/` beside the five existing suites, using the same
  directory-per-case shape so multi-module scenarios are expressible. This is
  where most of the real coverage lives, and it needs no LSP client at all.
- **Overlay tests**: a case where the on-disk text and the overlay text
  disagree, asserting the analysis reflects the overlay. This is the one bug
  class that no other test catches and that users will hit constantly.
- **Session tests**: pipe a scripted JSON-RPC conversation into the server
  and golden-diff the responses. `pygls` ships test helpers for driving a
  server in-process, which is easier than framing messages by hand. Include a
  scenario that edits a dependency and asserts the dependent's diagnostics
  update.
- **Truncation fuzz**: take each `examples/*.rald` (including the multi-module
  `examples/modules/` and `examples/ray_tracer/`), cut at every byte offset,
  assert the parser terminates without crashing and produces *some* AST. This
  one test catches the majority of error-recovery bugs, and it is ~15 lines of
  Python.
- **Position-encoding tests**: a file with emoji and combining characters,
  asserting that ranges land on the right characters in every editor.

---

## Suggested order

```
end positions in AST  →  parser error recovery  →  loader overlay hook
      →  --lsp-index JSON (multi-file)  →  pygls skeleton + sync + diagnostics
      →  semantic tokens  →  type side table  →  hover  →  symbol table
      →  goto-def (cross-file)  →  completion (incl. imports)
      →  workspace symbols  →  references / rename  →  inlay hints
      →  code actions
```

The first three steps are unglamorous compiler surgery with nothing to demo,
and it is tempting to skip ahead to the JSON-RPC loop where progress is
visible. Don't. Every feature past diagnostics is built on source ranges, on
parsing broken text, and — now that modules exist — on analyzing the buffers
the user actually has open rather than the files on disk. Retrofitting any of
the three later means touching every handler a second time.
