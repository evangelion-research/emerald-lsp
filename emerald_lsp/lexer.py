"""A pure-Python lexer for Emerald, mirroring ``../emerald/src/lexer.c``.

The compiler is the authority on Emerald's syntax; this exists because two
LSP features are *purely lexical* and must keep working when the import graph
is broken or the buffer does not parse: semantic tokens and the outline
(`docs/grammar.md`, DESIGN.md 6.2). Everything that needs types goes to
`emeraldc` instead -- see `emerald_lsp.compiler`.

Positions here are 0-based lines and 0-based *character* (UTF-32) columns,
which is what pygls wants internally; the UTF-16 conversion for the wire
happens once, at the boundary, in `emerald_lsp.positions`.
